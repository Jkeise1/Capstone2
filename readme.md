For this capstone I wanted to create a modern site with a old style twist. The homepage has a modern feel, while the mountain/national park pages have a comfortable warm feeling.

Ont interesting piece of css is wrote is having a intuitive navbar for my home page, it transitions from the right side of the page to display my HREFS.

Also want to give credit to Daemeon for providing me some code to get mines functioning! He's a major contributor into how my site was presented today!
